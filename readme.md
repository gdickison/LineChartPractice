## Line Chart Practice

Goals:
*  pull some data and use it to build three line charts: one in D3, one in ChartJS, and one in Google Charts
*  do it all in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.

Styling the charts was not a primary concern, so what styling exists is basically "out of the box."

Basic use:
*  Choose a country from the dropdown
*  The default chart is D3. Use the buttons to choose ChartJS or Google Chart options.
